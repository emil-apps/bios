# Basic Input/Output System
This is a recreation of the BIOS of the "Fujitsu Lifebook E782" laptop in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Try it out [here](https://emil-apps.github.io/bios/). As of March 13, 2025, you can only navigate between the pages. You currently can't change any settings, but that's planned.

## Navigating
Just like in every other BIOS, you can navigate between the pages using your arrow keys.

## For Developers
Use the URL parameter `github_icon=off` to hide the GitHub icon in the bottom right corner.
